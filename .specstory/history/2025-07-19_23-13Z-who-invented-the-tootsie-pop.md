<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking a simple question about who invented the Tootsie Pop. This is a general knowledge question that doesn't require any code analysis or file operations. I should just answer the question directly based on my knowledge.

The Tootsie Pop was invented by Luke Weisgram, an employee at the Sweets Company of America (which later became part of Tootsie Roll Industries), in 1931. It's a hard candy lollipop with a Tootsie Roll center.

Since this is just a general knowledge question and doesn't relate to the coding project in the workspace, I don't need to use any tools.</details></think>

Hello! The Tootsie Pop was invented by Luke Weisgram, an employee at the Sweets Company of America, in 1931. The Sweets Company of America later became part of Tootsie Roll Industries. 

The Tootsie Pop is famous for being a hard candy lollipop with a chewy Tootsie Roll center, and of course for inspiring the classic question "How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?" from their memorable TV commercials featuring Mr. Owl.

Is there anything related to your tnyOffice project that you'd like help with?
